# Wine to rule them all !

You must be logged in to GitHub in order to download Wine or Proton nightly builds.

## Affinity

This particular repo is a fork of the wine-tkg-git builder to generate builds with patches for Affinity software by Serif.

If you wish to contribute, please contribute to `tkg` (FUNDING yaml is unchanged), or to `_avg_` on the Affinity forums for making the patches we are using. Link to their repo: [https://github.com/oh-ok/wine-affinity-patches](https://github.com/oh-ok/wine-affinity-patches). 

If after you contributed, or supported those projects, you still want to support me, you can hit up my [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/yulian).

To get builds, please go to the Actions tab, select the build you want, and download the artifact.

(Please fix the ubuntu/fedora builds and mb upload some builds to the releases tab for backup purposes cuz as you know stuff get wiped from the actions tab after a while) (REMOVE THIS LINE ONCE UR DONE READING/AFTER MERGING)
